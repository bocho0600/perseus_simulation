Drive the excavation bucket's rams so they follow the linkage: the three 250 mm
rams (two lift, one tilt) and the two 50 mm jaw rams.

Why this node exists
--------------------
The rams close two kinematic loops, and nothing in Gazebo Harmonic can express
that on its own:

  * A real closed loop is refused by the physics backend -
    "Asked to create a joint between links [x] as parent and [y] as child, but
    the child link already has a parent joint" (gz-physics-dartsim).
  * URDF ``<mimic>`` does convert into SDF ``<mimic>``, but dartsim does not
    enforce it - the dependent joint sits frozen at zero.
  * And ``<mimic>`` is affine, whereas both the ram angle and its extension are
    nonlinear in the driving joint. The best affine fit still misses the rod-end
    pin by 30 mm mid-travel.

So the relations are solved here in closed form, exactly, and fed to the Gazebo
position controllers declared in ``bucket.urdf.xacro``.

Two modes
---------
* Simulation (default): reads /joint_states from Gazebo and drives the ram
  position controllers over the six /bucket/ram_*/cmd_* topics.
* Viewer (``viewer_mode:=true``): there is no Gazebo, only a joint-state slider
  GUI. The GUI's output is routed to ``input_topic`` (default
  /joint_states_raw); this node overwrites the ten ram joints with the exact
  values and re-publishes the lot on /joint_states for robot_state_publisher.
  That way moving the lift, tilt or jaw slider moves the rams too. It also
  republishes the description on /robot_description_sliders with the ram joints
  fixed, so the slider GUI shows only the joints you can actually move.

The rams are cosmetic: their mass is already lumped onto the frame, arm and
bucket, and they have no collision geometry and no gravity. If this node is not
running they simply hold their last pose.

Geometry (all measured from the Onshape export, see perseus_description/cad/bucket)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lift, in the frame's x-z plane, with the arm pivot at the origin:

    bracket   B = r * (cos a, sin a),  a = a_ext + q_lift
    ram base  P = (0, -d)
    ram vector V = B - P  ->  angle = atan2(Vz, Vx), extension = |V| - L_ret

Jaw, in the bucket's x-z plane: the rod pin is on the FRONT half, so it swings
about the jaw hinge by the jaw angle while the barrel pin stays put on the REAR
half. Both jaw actuators are planar and identical in x-z, so one angle and one
extension drive both sides.

Tilt, in the arm's x-z plane: the barrel is bolted to the plate on the arms, so
the anchor is fixed there, and the pin it drives is on the bucket - it has to be
swung into the arm frame by the tilt angle before the same subtraction.
